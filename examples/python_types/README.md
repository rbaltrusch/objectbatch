# Python types

This example contains a re-implementation of basic functionality for Python inbuilt types list and dict. The main purpose of this example is to showcase objectbatch as used to program with a real application in mind.

It includes the following methods:

Dict methods:
- get
- set
- delete

List methods:
- get
- set
- append
- pop
- print

## How to run

To run this example, run:

	cd /d <path_to_example_folder>
	main

Note that objectbatch needs to be on your [Windows PATH](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9546324/adding-a-directory-to-the-path-environment-variable-in-windows) in order to run this example.
