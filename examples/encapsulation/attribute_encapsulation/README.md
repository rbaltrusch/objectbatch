# Attribute encapsulation

Objectbatch does not support attribute encapsulation. Instead, a Python-like syntax may be adopted, with which names of attributes that are meant to be private start with an underscore (e.g. *_my_private_attr*).

## How to run

To run this example, run:

	cd /d <path_to_example_folder>
	main

Note that objectbatch needs to be on your [Windows PATH](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9546324/adding-a-directory-to-the-path-environment-variable-in-windows) in order to run this example.

## More information

For a basic example, please have a look at the [simple example](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/objectbatch/tree/master/examples/simple_class) first.

More information is available in the [other examples](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/objectbatch/tree/master/examples) and the [wiki](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/objectbatch/wiki).
